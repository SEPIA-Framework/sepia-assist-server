# TTS Engine: MBROLA Voices for Espeak-NG

Info: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/mbrola.md  
  
In this folder you will find the install script for MBROLA voices. The voices are used as plugins for Espeak-NG so you don't have to switch the engine. They are equally efficient and fast, but can sound considerably more natural.  
  
Please read the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file! While the voices are open and free not all of them can be used commercially without asking the creator for permission.
